# Ship Engine Anomaly Detection

### Objective
Detect operational anomalies in maritime engine sensor data using unsupervised learning techniques.

### Approach
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM to identify abnormal readings.
- Compared models for precision and sensitivity in outlier detection.
- Created Power BI dashboards to visualise fault signals and component-level variance.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
Power BI for anomaly dashboards.

### Results
- Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM provided robust early fault identification.
- PCA visualisations helped interpret sensor correlations and variance.
- Produced a scalable anomaly detection framework suitable for fleet-wide deployment.

### Key Learning
Reinforced the importance of explainable AI and visual clarity in technical environments such as maritime operations.
