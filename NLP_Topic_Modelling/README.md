# üß† Applying NLP for Topic Modelling in a Real-Life Context (Confidential Client Dataset)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This notebook presents an anonymised version of an applied data science project originally completed under NDA with a **UK-based fitness organisation (FastGym ‚Äì Confidential Client)**.  
> All datasets in this repository are **synthetic or publicly simulated** for demonstration purposes only.

### üéØ Objective

To uncover **customer satisfaction drivers** and **pain points** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques applied to anonymised gym review data.  
The aim was to help the client improve **member retention**, **service quality**, and **brand reputation** through data-driven insights.

### üß© Approach

#### üí¨ NLP Topic Modelling & Emotion Analysis
- Applied **BERTopic** and **Gensim LDA** to extract and interpret dominant themes from anonymised customer reviews.  
- Used **BERT-based emotion classification** to quantify emotional tone (*anger, sadness, joy, fear*) and isolate high-risk dissatisfaction.  
- Employed **Falcon-7B-Instruct** to summarise member feedback and generate **actionable business recommendations** via prompt-based inference.  
- Performed **comparative evaluation** of all models based on interpretability, coherence, and relevance to operational decision-making.  
- Maintained **full confidentiality compliance**, anonymising all textual and location identifiers.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

**Python Libraries:**  
BERTopic, Gensim, Transformers (BERT), Falcon-7B, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Analytical Techniques:**  
Topic Modelling ‚Ä¢ Emotion Detection ‚Ä¢ LLM Summarisation ‚Ä¢ Sentiment Correlation ‚Ä¢ Comparative NLP Evaluation

### üìä Results & Insights

- Identified six recurrent operational pain points: **hygiene**, **equipment reliability**, **staff responsiveness**, **digital access issues**, **overcrowding**, and **environmental discomfort**.  
- Quantified **emotional intensity** across reviews, highlighting anger and sadness as key churn indicators.  
- Validated cross-model consistency ‚Äî all approaches converged on the same **core dissatisfaction themes**.  
- Produced **clear, data-backed recommendations** for branch management, app development, and maintenance scheduling.  
- Demonstrated the complementary value of **BERTopic (contextual clustering)**, **LDA (lexical validation)**, and **Falcon (strategic synthesis)** in operational insight generation.

### üß† Key Learning

This project demonstrates how **multi-layered NLP pipelines** ‚Äî integrating clustering, transformer-based emotion analysis, and generative LLMs ‚Äî can extract both **semantic structure** and **emotional nuance** from unstructured customer feedback.  
It strengthened expertise in:
- Topic modelling and transformer-based NLP
- Model interpretability and validation
- Translating technical findings into **strategic business recommendations**
- Working under **NDA conditions** with anonymised data governance
