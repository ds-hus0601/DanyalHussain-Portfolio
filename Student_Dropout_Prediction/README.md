# Student Dropout Prediction

### Objective
Predict the likelihood of student dropout using engagement, academic, and demographic data across multiple stages.

### Approach
- Trained XGBoost and Neural Network models to classify dropout risk.
- Optimised hyperparameters through grid search for learning rate, epochs, and batch size.
- Evaluated model accuracy, F1 score, and recall for balanced performance.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy)  
Matplotlib and Seaborn for performance visualisation.

### Results
- XGBoost achieved ~89% accuracy with balanced recall.
- Neural Network demonstrated superior generalisation after tuning.
- Provided actionable insights for improving student retention.

### Key Learning
Highlighted the ethical dimension of predictive modelling in educationâ€”balancing accuracy with fairness and interpretability.
