# Spam Classification

### Objective
Build and compare machine learning models to classify emails and text messages as spam or legitimate.

### Approach
- Implemented Logistic Regression and a four-layer Neural Network.
- Conducted preprocessing, feature extraction, and tokenisation.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 metrics.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

### Results
- Logistic Regression achieved strong baseline performance with interpretability.
- Neural Network improved recall by ~6%, identifying more spam correctly.
- Documented model trade-offs between complexity and transparency.

### Key Learning
Understanding model simplicity versus performance is critical in real-world classification systems.
