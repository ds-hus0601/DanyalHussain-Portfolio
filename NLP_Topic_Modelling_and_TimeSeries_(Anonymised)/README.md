# üß† Applying NLP and Time Series Analysis in a Real-Life Context (Confidential Client Dataset)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This notebook presents an anonymised version of an applied data science project originally completed under NDA with a UK fitness organisation.  
> All datasets here are synthetic or publicly simulated for demonstration purposes only.

### Objective
To uncover customer engagement patterns and satisfaction drivers using a combination of **time-series forecasting** and **natural language processing (NLP)**.  
The project aimed to inform retention strategy and operational planning through both quantitative and qualitative insights.

---

### Approach
#### üïí Part 1: Time Series Analysis
- Analysed anonymised transactional data to forecast weekly demand and activity trends.  
- Applied **moving averages**, **trend decomposition**, and **seasonality visualisation** to identify engagement peaks.  
- Demonstrated the relationship between sales cycles and customer behaviour.

#### üí¨ Part 2: NLP Topic Modelling
- Applied **BERTopic** and **Gensim LDA** to extract topics from anonymised customer feedback.  
- Conducted **BERT emotion analysis** to classify sentiment intensity and tone.  
- Used **Falcon-7B-Instruct** for prompt-based summarisation and strategic insight generation.  
- Maintained full compliance with data confidentiality by anonymising all identifiable text fields.

---

### Tools & Techniques
Python (BERTopic, Gensim, FinBERT, Falcon-7B, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Seaborn)

---

### Results
- Identified recurring **customer experience themes** and emotional drivers influencing satisfaction.  
- Forecasted **weekly engagement patterns** that aligned with operational data trends.  
- Produced actionable insights to improve customer retention, service delivery, and engagement timing.  

---

### Key Learning
This project demonstrated how **multi-modal analytics** ‚Äî combining NLP and time-series methods ‚Äî can deliver rich, actionable insights even when working under **NDA restrictions**.  
It strengthened skills in text processing, trend analysis, and ethical handling of confidential datasets.
