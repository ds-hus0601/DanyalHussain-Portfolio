# üè¶ Bank of England ‚Äì Financial Sentiment & Prudential Metrics

> üß© This project was completed as part of the **University of Cambridge Data Science & Machine Learning Career Accelerator (2025)** in collaboration with the **Bank of England Employer Project**.  
> It explores how sentiment and prudential data interact across major UK banks using advanced NLP and financial analytics.

### Objective
To analyse quarterly earnings call transcripts from major UK banks and link executive and analyst sentiment to prudential metrics such as **CET1**, **NSFR**, **LCR**, and **LDR**.  
The goal was to identify patterns in financial tone that correspond to stability, liquidity, and lending confidence.

---

### Approach
- Used **FinBERT** and **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** to measure tone across earnings calls.  
- Extracted executive and analyst dialogue separately for comparative sentiment analysis.  
- Integrated sentiment scores with prudential metrics using **temporal alignment** (pooled and per-bank).  
- Conducted **correlation and rolling-window analysis** to examine sentiment‚Äìmetric interactions.  
- Visualised findings with **Power BI** dashboards and Python-based charts for interpretability.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, FinBERT, Scikit-learn)  
Power BI for interactive visualisation and stakeholder reporting  

---

### Results
- Identified consistent differences between **executive optimism** and **analyst caution**.  
- Observed a **positive correlation between NSFR and sentiment** (indicating stability-linked confidence).  
- Detected mild **negative sentiment association with CET1** during capital-building phases.  
- Demonstrated how tone patterns can serve as early indicators of financial posture shifts.  
- Presented results to Bank of England representatives as part of a 15-minute technical presentation.

### Key Learning
This project showed how **NLP can enhance financial monitoring** by quantifying qualitative tone.  
It strengthened practical skills in **sentiment analysis, time-series integration, and dashboard storytelling**, bridging the gap between textual data and prudential insight.
