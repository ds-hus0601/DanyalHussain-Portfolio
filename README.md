# 👋 Hi, I'm Danyal Hussain

I'm a data analyst based in London, with a background in biomedical sciences and a certification in Data Science & Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge.  
I enjoy using Python, SQL, and Power BI to turn complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my applied projects from Cambridge and beyond – covering NLP, predictive modelling, and anomaly detection across diverse domains.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🏦 Bank of England – Financial Sentiment & Prudential Metrics
Analysed earnings call transcripts from major UK banks using FinBERT and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA).  
Linked tone to prudential metrics (CET1, NSFR, LCR, LDR) and visualised temporal correlations in Power BI dashboards.

🔹 *Tech:* Python, FinBERT, Pandas, Power BI  
🔹 *Skills:* NLP, correlation analysis, financial modelling

---

### ⚙️ Ship Engine Anomaly Detection
Applied PCA, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM to identify abnormal sensor patterns in maritime engine data.  
Provided early-warning visualisations and performance monitoring dashboards.

🔹 *Tech:* Python, Scikit-learn, Power BI  
🔹 *Skills:* Unsupervised learning, anomaly detection, dashboarding

---

### 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction
Built predictive models (XGBoost, Neural Networks) to identify students at risk of dropout using engagement and academic data.  
Evaluated accuracy, F1 score, and recall, and offered practical retention strategies.

🔹 *Tech:* Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
🔹 *Skills:* Supervised learning, feature importance, model evaluation

---

### 🔍 NLP Topic Modelling (Confidential Client Dataset)
Applied BERTopic, Gensim LDA, and BERT emotion analysis to customer reviews to uncover key experience themes and sentiment trends.  
(Conducted under NDA, so dataset and company name omitted.)

🔹 *Tech:* Python, BERTopic, FinBERT, Gensim  
🔹 *Skills:* NLP, sentiment analysis, topic modelling

---

### 🧩 Customer Segmentation with Clustering
Segmented e-commerce customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) and cost-based features to inform marketing strategy.  
Compared K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, visualised group separability with PCA and t-SNE.

🔹 *Tech:* Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
🔹 *Skills:* Clustering, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, customer analytics
