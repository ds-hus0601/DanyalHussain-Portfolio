# üß† Applying NLP for Topic Modelling in a Real-Life Context (Confidential Client Dataset)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This notebook presents an anonymised version of an applied data science project originally completed under NDA with a UK fitness organisation.  
> All datasets here are synthetic or publicly simulated for demonstration purposes only.

### Objective
To uncover **customer satisfaction drivers** and **pain points** using advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques on anonymised review data.  
The goal was to help the client improve retention, service quality, and reputation management through data-driven insight.

### Approach
#### üí¨ NLP Topic Modelling and Emotion Analysis
- Applied **BERTopic** and **Gensim LDA** to extract dominant themes from anonymised customer reviews.  
- Used **BERT emotion classification** to detect emotional intensity (anger, sadness, joy, etc.) and isolate high-risk complaints.  
- Leveraged **Falcon-7B-Instruct** for prompt-based summarisation and actionable recommendation generation.  
- Conducted **comparative model evaluation** to assess interpretability, coherence, and business utility across NLP techniques.  
- Ensured full compliance with confidentiality requirements by anonymising all text fields.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (BERTopic, Gensim, BERT, Falcon-7B, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

---

### Results
- Identified recurring **customer experience issues** such as hygiene, equipment maintenance, access failures, and staff behaviour.  
- Mapped **emotional intensity** across reviews to flag reputational risks and churn triggers.  
- Generated **actionable business recommendations** for operations, maintenance, and customer engagement teams.  
- Demonstrated the comparative value of **BERTopic, LDA, and generative LLMs** in extracting interpretable insights from unstructured feedback.

### Key Learning
This project highlights how **multi-layered NLP analysis** ‚Äî combining clustering, emotion detection, and LLM summarisation ‚Äî can reveal not just what customers say, but **how they feel**.  
It reinforced expertise in topic modelling, model comparison, and translating technical findings into strategic business insights under NDA conditions.
