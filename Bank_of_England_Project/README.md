# Bank of England â€“ Financial Sentiment & Prudential Metrics

### Objective
Analyse quarterly earnings call transcripts from major UK banks to measure sentiment and relate managerial tone to prudential metrics such as CET1, NSFR, LCR, and LDR.

### Approach
- Used FinBERT and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to classify sentiment at both sentence and topic levels.
- Conducted temporal correlation analysis between sentiment indices and prudential ratios.
- Built Power BI dashboards for cross-bank and pooled trend comparisons.

### Tools & Techniques
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, FinBERT, Scikit-learn)  
Power BI for data visualisation and presentation.

### Results
- Identified measurable tone shifts linked to liquidity and capital metrics.
- Found that confident sentiment often aligned with higher NSFR stability, while cautious tone accompanied CET1 build periods.
- Presented findings to Bank of England representatives as part of the Cambridge Employer Project.

### Key Learning
Demonstrated how NLP models like FinBERT can complement prudential data to enhance regulatory and financial insight.
